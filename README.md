# Video-searcher-emb

![](/public/video-search-emb.gif)

- Fun app, containing few components that combined together create a video search.
- I have used **axios** to fetch [youtube](https://www.youtube.com) so I can embed some videos.
- [semantic ui](https://semantic-ui.com/) for some basic styling.

## Getting Started

- `git clone https://github.com/Chagorovski/video-search-emb.git`
- add youtube api key in `youtube.js`
- run `npm start`
- and on `localhost:3000` open app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
